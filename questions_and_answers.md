### 4) What % of all PK-3 grader referrals resulting in out-of-class or other resolutions by race.

```
./by_race2.pl --grades "'PK', 'KG', 1, 2, 3" --category out_of_class
African American|7211|10652|67.70

Sanity check: Show all Pacific Islanders:

```
SELECT disc.resolutionName, category
FROM disc
LEFT OUTER JOIN resolution_categories rc ON (disc.resolutionName = rc.resolutionName)
WHERE Grade IN ('PK', 'KG', 1, 2, 3)
AND RaceEthnicity = 'Pacific Islander';
```

Oh... ya, sometimes in our original .xlsx data `resolutionName` is NULL. So that explains
why sometimes resolutions aren't `postitive` nor `out_of_class` nor `other`. So apparently
this is a feature, not a bug, given our original data source.

### 5) Number of all PK-3 grader referrals resulting in each of these: a. referrals to counselors, b. referrals to social workers and c. referral/consult with school psychologist.

```
SELECT resolutionName, count(*)
FROM disc
WHERE Grade IN ('PK', 'KG', 1, 2, 3)
AND resolutionName like '%referral%'
COLLATE NOCASE
GROUP BY 1;

Consultation with/Referral to School Psychologist|7
Referral to Community Agency|3
Referral to Community Counselor|1
```
